# Peeled Apart

Video Overview: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wj2katlyxBci-eXwRkCE0G68fNoWcUBu/view?usp=drive_link

A game made with C# in Unity, both for fun and to improve my software engineering skills. 
The player takes on the role of a monkey escaping from a hungry lion. The object of the game is to collect bananas and avoid getting caught by strategically outmaneuvering the lion on a tile-based map.
All programming and technical work was completed by myself, Thomas Bowler, with assistance of ChatGPT. 
Please visit the Attributions folder in this repository to see other contributors to the creative aspects of the game.
